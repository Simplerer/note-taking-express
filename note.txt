db.json will be the storage of notes, this file needs to be read with the fs.readfilesync

the file must be read, stringified, and parsed  -  like the activity we did earlier..20

The __dirname in a node script returns the path of the folder where the current JavaScript file resides. __filename and __dirname are used to get the filename and directory name of the currently executing file.

FROM EXPRESS DOCUMENTATION

Route parameters
Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.

Route path: /users/:userId/books/:bookId
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/34/books/8989
req.params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }
To define routes with route parameters, simply specify the route parameters in the path of the route as shown below.

app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.params)
})

Getting Started
On the back end, the application should include a db.json file that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.
The following HTML routes should be created:


GET /notes should return the notes.html file.


GET * should return the index.html file.


The following API routes should be created:


GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.


POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).
